[00:15.10] I want to live where soul meets body
[00:23.45] And let the sun wrap its arms around me
[00:30.92] And bathe my skin in water cool and cleansing
[00:37.17] And feel, feel what its like to be new
[00:56.17] 
[00:45.71] Cause in my head there's a greyhound station
[00:53.07] Where I send my thoughts to far off destinations
[00:59.78] So they may have a chance of finding a place
[01:06.50] Where they're far more suited than here
[01:26.00] 
[01:42.17] And I cannot guess what we'll discover
[01:49.91] When we turn the dirt with our palms cupped like shovels
[01:56.33] But I know our filthy hands can wash one another's
[02:03.81] And not one speck will remain
[02:18.31] 
[02:08.12] And I do believe it's true
[02:10.58] That there are roads left in both of our shoes
[02:14.00] But if the silence takes you
[02:17.56] Then I hope it takes me too
[02:22.66] So brown eyes I hold you near
[02:25.36] Cause you're the only song I want to hear
[02:29.06] A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
[02:51.56] 
[02:37.48] Where soul meets body
[02:44.62] Where soul meets body
[02:48.92] Where soul meets body
[02:59.42] 
[02:56.43] And I do believe it's true
[02:59.18] That there are roads left in both of our shoes
[03:02.83] But if the silence takes you
[03:05.80] Then I hope it takes me too
[03:11.22] So brown eyes I hold you near
[03:14.13] Cause you're the only song I want to hear
[03:17.89] A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
[03:25.48] A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
[03:32.96] A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
[03:40.79] A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
