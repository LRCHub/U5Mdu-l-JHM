I'm a rolling stone
I'm too wild for you to own
In a whip that's meant to speed
If I hurt you would you leave?
I learned the game
from some heavyweights
Catching buses,
making change from another play
I still got demons
from my younger days
I wish I could shake 'em
but they follow me
I wish I could take it easy
but these fans watch
Ask my mama, I been hustlin'
since the sand box
I'm a rolling stone
I'm sorry in advance
if I let you down
I'm sorry in advance
if I let you down
Bitch, you just spilled Louis 13
on my McQueens
Back the fuck up
I got all this pimp shit up
in my genes
Blame that on my mother
I can't go nowhere
that's less than me
Ask my lovers, I'm troubled
First I'm exciting
then I'm gaslighting,
make up your mind
I'm rich as fuck
and I ain't nothing
at the same time
People hate me
and they love me
at the same time
I guess I'm everything
and nothing at the same time
I'm sorry in advance
if I let you down
(I'm a rolling stone)
I'm sorry in advance
if I let you down
